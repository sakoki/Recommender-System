- Pandas
- SciPy
- Sklearn
- Surprise 

## Files:
1. Data_Preparation.ipynb - Process data into useful format as well as some exploration of data
2. dev.ipynb - Development notebook for testing various approaches and measuring their performance
3. make_predictions.ipynb - Choose best method from development and generate file with predictions
4. decorators.py - Decorator useful for development
5. evaluations.py - Function for measuring RMSE score
6. predictions.py - Functions used for generating predictions
