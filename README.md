# Recommender-System
Exploring various methods for building a recommendation system using Netflix movie review data 

## Method:

For this project, I created a Item-Based Collaboratie Filtering, SlopeOne, and Matrix Factorization using SVD (Singule Value Decomposition).

The following libraries were used:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Sklearn
- Surprise 

Files:
1. Data_Preparation.ipynb - Process data into useful format as well as some exploration of data
2. dev.ipynb - Development notebook for developing various approaches and measuring their performance
3. make_predictions.ipynb - Train SVD model and generate file with predictions
4. decorators.py - Decorator's useful for developing 
5. evaluations.py - Function for measure RMSE score
6. predictions.py - Functions used for generating predictions
